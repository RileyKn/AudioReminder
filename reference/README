cd into "reference" first
1st Terminal : to run back-end (MUST do cd backend) (mongodb file upload buttom in Website not working so the audio isn't being saved anywhere)
DO: node server.js
2nd Terminal : to run front-end(src) run from cd reference
DO: npm start

you can add a "base64.txt" file into the backend directory to then have it converted to a .mp3 file in the public directory
